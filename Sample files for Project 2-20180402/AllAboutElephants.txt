Elephants are intelligent mammals.  They have funeral rites for their dead.  They are one of three species of mammal that have a sense of self awareness.  That is, they can recognize that a mirror image is not another elephant but is an image of themselves.  Unfortunately, many elephants have been killed by poachers who take their tusks for ivory.
